<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I live in Medellin.Actually I am a senior C/C++ Developer. I had to learn web programming for IoT technology and remote control of vending machines. But I love web programming which is very enjoyable. It is even more enjoyable to learn with Angela. She is a very good teacher.</p>

<p>I am currently in Medellin, one of the best cities in the world. It is known as the city of eternal spring. Waking up to a spring morning every day, seeing the sun, and smelling the spring scent is truly a wonderful and enjoyable thing. I write code every spring morning and I love it. I am also learning Spanish.</p>
